  abstract =      {Phase transitions in a continuum Curie-Weiss system
                   of interacting particles are studied quantitatively.
                   The interaction is determined by a division of the
                   underlying space {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathbb
                   {\{}R{\}}^d{\$}{\$}into congruent cubic cells. For a
                   region {\$}{\$}V{\backslash}subset {\backslash}mathbb
                   {\{}R{\}}^d{\$}{\$}consisting of
                   {\$}{\$}N{\backslash}in {\backslash}mathbb
                   {\{}N{\}}{\$}{\$}cells, each two particles contained
                   in V attract each other with intensity
                   {\$}{\$}J{\_}1/N{\$}{\$}. The particles contained in
                   the same cell repel each other with intensity
                   {\$}{\$}J{\_}2>J{\_}1{\$}{\$}. For fixed values of
                   the intensities {\$}{\$}J{\_}1, J{\_}2{\$}{\$}, the
                   temperature and the chemical potential, the
                   thermodynamic phase is defined as a probability
                   measure on the space of occupation numbers of cells.
                   There is shown that the half-plane
                   {\$}{\$}J{\_}1{\backslash},{\backslash}times
                   {\backslash},{\$}{\$} chemical potential contains
                   phase coexistence points, and thus multiple
                   thermodynamic phases of the system may exist at the
                   same values of the temperature and chemical
                   potential. The numerical calculations describing such
                   phenomena are presented.},

  abstract =      {The previously proposed approach for the microscopic
                   description of the critical behavior of Morse liquids
                   based on the cell fluid model is applied to the case
                   where the parameters of the Morse interaction
                   potential correspond to alkali metals (sodium and
                   potassium). The critical temperatures, densities, and
                   pressures obtained for sodium and potassium agree
                   with the experimental results. The thermodynamic
                   coefficients (isothermal compressibility, density
                   fluctuations, and thermal expansion) of sodium are
                   investigated in the supercritical temperature region.
                   Numerical calculations of thermodynamic coefficients
                   are performed close to the critical point, where
                   carrying out theoretical and experimental research is
                   challenging. The change in compressibility with
                   increasing density at various temperature values is
                   traced. The behavior of density fluctuations
                   approaching the critical point is shown for different
                   temperatures. The variation in the magnitude of the
                   thermal expansion with increasing temperature for
                   different pressure values is illustrated.},
