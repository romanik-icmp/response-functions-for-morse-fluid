	\section{Introduction}
	
	In this work we continue our study of the thermodynamic behavior of a cell fluid model, which was defined in~[Kozytskii et al. (2018); Kozytskii et al. (2020)]. In~[Kozlovskii $\&$ Dobush (2020); Pylyuk $\&$ Dobush (2020); Pylyuk at al., J. Mol. Liq. (2023); Pylyuk at al., Ukr. J. Phys. (2023)] this model was used with a modified Morse potential describing the particle interaction. In particular, the equation of state was obtained in~[Kozlovskii $\&$ Dobush (2020)] in the zero-mode approximation. This equation of state is used in the current work to calculate thermodynamic response functions, namely the isothermal compressibility, the thermal pressure coefficient, and the thermal expansion coefficient.
	
	\section{The interaction potential}
	The potential of interaction between particles is taken in a form of a modified Morse potential
	\begin{equation}
		U(r) = C_{H} \left[A {\rm e}^{-n_0(r-R_0)/\alpha} + {\rm e}^{-\gamma(r - R_0)/\alpha} -2{\rm e}^{-(r-R_0)/\alpha}\right],
	\end{equation}
	where $R_0$ is the coordinate of the potential minimum, $\alpha$ is an effective range of interaction, $\gamma$ and $n_0$ are parameters of the model. Other two constants $C_{H}$ and $A$ are expressed via $\gamma$ and $n_0$ as
	\begin{equation}
		C_{H} = \frac{\varepsilon n_0}{n_0 + \gamma - 2}, \quad A = \frac{2 - \gamma}{n_0},
	\end{equation}
	where $\varepsilon$ is the depth of the potential well at $r=R_0$. This potential is reduced to the ordinary Morse potential~[Morse (1929)] at $\gamma=2$. For a more detailed discussion of such modified Morse potential, see Sections~1 and~2 in~[Kozlovskii $\&$ Dobush (2020)].
	
	Modifications of the Morse potential were used in other works as well. For example, in~[Martinez-Valencia at al. (2013)] a repulsive term in a form of a power of $r^{-1}$ was added to the ordinary Morse potential, and the influence of the softness of such a term was investigated on the coordinates of the critical point. The generalized form of the Morse potential was suggested in~[Biswas $\&$ Hamann (1985)]
	\begin{equation}
		U(r) = A_1 {\rm e}^{-\lambda_1 r} + A_2 {\rm e}^{-\lambda_2 r}
	\end{equation} 
	with application to silicon structural energies, and was also considered in~[Lim, Acta Chim. Slov. (2005)] as the potential for Be-S and H-Na compounds.
	
	Our modification contains an additional repulsive term, similar to~[Martinez-Valencia at al. (2013)], as well as introduces parameter $\gamma$, which can vary as opposed to being strictly equal to 2 in the Morse potential. Including the repulsive term enables us to single out a reference system and apply the method of collective variables to calculating the grand partition function~[REFERENCE NEEDED].
	
	\section{The equation of state}
	The equation of state obtained in [Kozlovskii $\&$ Dobush (2020)] reads
	\begin{equation}
		\label{eq:eos}
		Pv\beta = E_\mu(M, T) + M \bar \rho_0 + \frac{1}{2} \tilde D(0) \bar \rho_0^2 - \frac{a_4}{24} \bar \rho_0^4.
	\end{equation}
	[EXPLICIT EXPRESSIONS FOR QUANTITIES ENTERING THE EQUATION OF STATE FOLLOW HERE OR REFERENCE IS MADE TO AN APPENDIX].
	The latter expression links the pressure $P$, the temperature $T$ ($\beta = 1/T$ is the inverse temperature), the cell's volume $v$ and the effective chemical potential $M$. In general $M$ is a function of the real chemical potential $\mu$:
	\begin{align}
		&	M = \frac{\tilde\mu}{W(0)} + g_1 + n_c \tilde D(0) - \frac{1}{6} \frac{g_3^3}{g_4^2}, \\
		&	\tilde\mu=\mu-\mu^*(1+\tau),
	\end{align}
	here $\mu^*$ is some positive constant, and $\tau$ is the relative temperature $\tau = (T - T_c) / T_c$,
	$T_c$ is the critical temperature. $W(0)$ is what we call an effective interaction potential\footnote{\textbf{explain} what is the effective interaction potential in a few words} at ${\bf k} = 0$:
	\begin{equation}
	W(0) = \Phi^{(r)}(0) \left[ B - 1 + \chi_0 + \tau (\chi_0 + A_\gamma) \right].
	\end{equation}
	Here $\chi_0$ is a constant parameter, the quantities $B$ and $A_\gamma$ reads
	\begin{align} 
		& B = 2 \gamma^3 e^{(1-\gamma)/\alpha},\nonumber \\
		& A_\gamma = A e^{(n_0-\gamma)/\alpha} \left( \gamma / n_0\right)^3.
	\end{align}
	The coefficients $g_n$ are given by the formulas:
	\begin{align}
		& g_0 = \ln T_0, \qquad g_1 = T_1/T_0, \qquad g_2 = T_2/T_0 - g_1^2,  \nonumber \\
		& g_3 = T_3/T_0 - g_1^3 - 3g_1 g_2, \quad \qquad  g_4 = T_4/T_0 - g_1^4 - 6 g_1^2 g_2 - 4 g_1 g_3 - 3 g_2^2,
	\end{align}
	where $T_n(p,\alpha^*)$ are the following special functions
	\begin{equation}
	T_n(p,\alpha^*) = \sum_{m=0}^{\infty} \frac{(\alpha^*)^m}{m!} m^n e^{pm^2}.
	\end{equation}
	Here $\alpha^*=v e^{\beta_c\mu^*}$, and the parameter $p$ has the form
	\begin{equation}
	p = \frac{\beta_c}{2} \Phi^{(r)}(0) [\chi_0 + A_\gamma].
	\end{equation} 
	Note that we denote $\beta_c$ as the inverse critical temperature. Since $p$ fails to be the function of temperature, the coefficients $g_n$ are also temperature-free. The quantity $\tilde D(0)$ which has already appeared in both equations \eqref{eq:eos} and \eqref{3d2} is a function of temperature
	\begin{equation}
	\tilde D(0) = g_2 - \frac{1}{2} \frac{g_3^2}{g_4} - \frac{1}{\beta W(0)},
	\end{equation}
	which equals zero at $T=T_c$. This circumstance gives us an expression for determining the critical temperature 
	\begin{equation}
		T_c = \left(g_2 - \frac{1}{2} \frac{g_3^2}{g_4} \right) (B - 1 + \chi_0) \Phi^{(r)}(0).
	\end{equation}    
	The function $E_\mu(M, T)$ from the equation \eqref{eq:eos} is provided by
	\begin{align}
		& E_\mu (M, T) = - \frac{1}{2 N_v} \ln (2\pi \beta W(0)) +  g_0 - \frac{\beta W(0)}{2} \!\! \left( \! \frac{\tilde\mu}{W(0)} \! \right)^{\! 2} \!\!\! - \frac{g_3}{g_4} {M} \! - \frac{g_3^2}{2 g_4^2}  \tilde D(0) - \frac{1}{24} \frac{g_3^4}{g_4^3}. 
	\end{align}
	Note that for all $ \tau> 0 $ there are no restrictions on the value of $ \bar \rho_0 $, which is a function of the temperature and the chemical potential
	\begin{equation}\label{2d18}
	\bar \rho_0 = \left(- \frac{3\bar{M}}{g_4} + \sqrt{Q_t}\right)^{1/3} - \left(  \frac{3\bar{M}}{g_4} + \sqrt{Q_t} \right)^{1/3} \!\!\!\! ,
	\end{equation}
	where
	\begin{equation}
	Q_t = \left(  \frac{2\tilde D(0)}{g_4}\right)^3 + \left( -\frac{3\bar{M}}{g_4}\right)^2, \qquad g_4<0.
	\end{equation}  
	...
	\begin{equation}\label{3d3}
	\bar n = n_g - \bar{M} + \tilde g_2 \gamma_\tau \bar \rho_0,
	\end{equation}
	where
	\begin{equation}\label{3d4}
	n_g = g_1 + n_c \tilde g_2 - \frac{1}{6} g_3^3 / g_4^2.
	\end{equation}
	...
